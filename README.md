Example of nodejs github package usage



## Basic usage
First you need export your secret token into your session (it has to be the same as the package) e.g:
  ```
  $ export GITHUB_TOKEN="my-value-token"
  ```
Once this is done, you can install it:
  ```
  $ npm install @alfonsodguez/nodejs-github-package@1.0.2
  ```
